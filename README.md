# Space Duel II

On Friday 2020-04-17 and Sunday 2020-04-19, I'm [coding this on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/occupy_paul_st).

I'm attempting to make a sequel to [Space Duel](https://paulkernfeld.com/2012/07/16/space-duel.html), a local multiplayer asteroids-style game that I made in high school. Who is better at programming: 15-year-old me or 30-year-old me?

# TODO

1. Choose a game engine
2. Come up with a minimal fun prototype
3. Implement (in Rust)

# Space Duel II

I'm [coding this live on Twitch right now](https://www.twitch.tv/occupy_paul_st).

I'm attempting to make a sequel to [Space Duel](https://paulkernfeld.com/2012/07/16/space-duel.html), a local multiplayer asteroids-style game that I made in high school. Who is better at programming: 15-year-old me or 30-year-old me?

The goals of this project are to have fun, learn some new things, and try to make a game!

# Choosing a game engine

Since I'm planning to spend single-digit hours on this project and I haven't made a game in Rust before, I want to choose a game engine that will let me get started easily. Choosing the right game engine for this kind of project could have a multiplicative effect on my productivity. I'm going to start with a shortlist of Rust game engines that I've heard of. I'm using [Are we game yet?](https://arewegameyet.com/ecosystem/engines/) as a reference. I'm going to choose from:

- [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/)
- [piston](https://www.piston.rs/)
- [coffee](https://github.com/hecrj/coffee)
- [ggez](https://crates.io/crates/ggez)

# TODO

1. Choose a game engine
2. Come up with a minimal fun prototype
3. Implement (in Rust)
